# JBoss Data Grid + Single Sign On + REST API
This tiny app is to test and have an overview about sending and retrieving data in memory with Red Hat JBoss Data Grid (through a REST API), having a security layer (and single sign-on) when accessing webpages with Red Hat Single Sign-On (in this case only /index.jsp).

- Structure:
  It works very simples. It's a person register which we send the person name, age and ID and Data Grid receives the data through Hot Rod (we retrieve through ID only).
  

# Prerequisites
